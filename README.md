# ISproject

This is a project I did as an Independant study with a professor at UMASS Amherst. The intention of the study was to help create a class revolving around JavaScript game development. I was tasked with researching a game engine (I chose Phaser) and both building a game and providing advice on how best to construct a course around game development.

What is seen here is the finished game, it is a small bare bones platformer featuring Olaf from the Lost Vikings where you jump around and collect coins in a single level. The main purpose of this project was to show how Phaser worked while building up a tool box for students to use.
